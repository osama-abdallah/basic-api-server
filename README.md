## My notes

i learned about sequelise for the first time a much easier way to deal with databases we implemented multiple methods for it and it was very informative and easy method to substitute for the queries which we learnt in the prepmonth a lot of thing were different the routing and the addition of the models files with an index,js file in it but all in all I do see myself carrying this out more than the previous way as it takes a lot less effort.
